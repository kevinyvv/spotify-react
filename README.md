# Spotify Discover Weekly Whenever
Web app designed to help users' find the music they want - whenever.
Based off Spotify's "Discover Weekly" feature, but able to be used whenever.

# Technologies Used
### React (Frontend)
### Javascript (API Calls)

# Functions

App is live [here](https://kevinyvv.github.io/spotify-react).
If interested in trying/using the app, email or message me to add your Spotify account to the app's Spotify permissions (this is due to Spotify's restrictions on API usage).


## Get Top Songs

Grabs users' top songs based on listening history and displays them. Option to choose duration of listening history, and amount of songs.
 

## Generate Recommendations

Generates a list of recommended songs based on Spotify's recommendation algorithm. Option to choose amount of songs generated.

## Create Playlist

Easily save generated recommendations as a playlist with the click of a button.

# To Do

## Publish App/Apply for Publication
In order for users' to freely use the application without being listed, the app must be published through the Spotify Developer portal. I hope to implement some further improvements, then apply for publication.

## More Options!
I'd like to add more options, including 
- generate playlist based on custom songs
- generate playlist based on mood
